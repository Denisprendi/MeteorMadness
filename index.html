    <p>
      Have you ever seen a shooting star? Those bright streaks in the night sky are meteors‚Äîspace rocks burning up as they zoom through Earth's atmosphere. Sometimes, bigger space rocks called asteroids come close or even hit Earth. While most are small and harmless, some could cause serious damage if they hit us. Scientists all over the world watch these space visitors carefully and are working on ways to protect Earth, like sending spacecraft to gently push dangerous asteroids away. Understanding meteors and asteroids helps us stay safe and keeps our planet ready for anything from space!

      "Asteroids are much smaller than planets, but they can still be deadly if they hit Earth.",
      "There are more than a million known asteroids in our solar system.",
      "Meteors are pieces of asteroids or comets that enter Earth's atmosphere.",
      "An asteroid called Apophis will pass close to Earth in 2029, but it won‚Äôt hit us.",

      "Asteroids are thought to be the building blocks of planets in our solar system.",
      "Meteors are visible because they heat up to millions of degrees as they burn up in the atmosphere.",
      "A meteor's bright trail is caused by the friction between the meteor and Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Scientists believe that asteroids may have played a role in creating life on Earth.",

      "Asteroids can be classified into three types: carbonaceous, silicate, and metallic.",
      "A comet's tail is formed by the solar wind pushing gas and dust away from it.",
      "Meteors create bright streaks because they are heated to extreme temperatures as they enter the atmosphere.",

      "There is a near-Earth asteroid named 2019 QK, which is about 15 meters in diameter.",
      "The Hoba meteorite, found in Namibia, is the largest known single meteorite on Earth.",
      "Some meteorites are so rare and precious that they are worth millions of dollars.",
      "Meteors can burn up at altitudes of up to 75 miles, creating a stunning light show.",
      "Spacecraft have even been sent to explore asteroids, like NASA's Dawn mission to Vesta and Ceres.",
      "Asteroids can cause significant damage if they hit Earth, as seen in the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor explosion.",
      "Meteors can leave behind meteorites, which are used by scientists to learn more about space.",
      "Astronomers use telescopes to track asteroids and predict their orbits to avoid potential collisions."
